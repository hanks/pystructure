# pystructure
A tiny tool to help reading source code with showing structure of python source code

# Why

I use PyCharm as my python IDE, and sometimes I can use `structure` navigation bar to check source code easily, like
below:

[structure]()

# Installation

`pip install pystructure`

# Unit Test

`tox`
